## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.0-beta.1] - 2025-10-04

### üéâ Initial Beta Release

The first beta release of `fdu` (faster date-time utility) - an ultra-fast, zero-dependency JavaScript date-time library.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Core Date Manipulation**
  - Create date instances from Date objects, strings, timestamps, or current time
  - Immutable operations (all methods return new instances)
  - Chainable API for fluent date manipulation

- **Formatting**
  - Day.js-compatible format tokens (YYYY, MM, DD, HH, mm, ss, etc.)
  - Full month/weekday names and abbreviations
  - AM/PM support for 12-hour format
  - Escaped literal text with square brackets `[...]`
  - Locale-aware formatting

- **Date Arithmetic**
  - Add/subtract years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds
  - Automatic month overflow handling (Jan 31 + 1 month ‚Üí Feb 28/29)
  - Leap year support

- **Comparisons**
  - `isBefore()`, `isAfter()`, `isSame()` methods
  - Unit-based comparison (compare by year, month, day, etc.)
  - `diff()` method with multiple unit support

- **Query Methods**
  - Get year, month, date, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond
  - Convert to Date, ISO string, Unix timestamp
  - Validation with `isValid()`

- **Comprehensive Internationalization (i18n)**
  - 11 built-in locales: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese (Simplified), Thai
  - Global locale setting with `locale(name)` function
  - Instance-level locale override with `.locale(name)` method
  - Locale persistence through chained operations
  - Graceful fallback to English for unregistered locales
  - Tree-shakable locale files (~300-500 bytes gzipped each)
  - Ordinal day formatting with `Do` token (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
  - Custom meridiem functions for cultural time-of-day naming

- **TypeScript**
  - Full TypeScript support with strict types
  - Excellent IntelliSense and auto-completion
  - No `any` types in public APIs

### üìä Performance

- **2x faster** than Day.js for common operations
- Sub-10Œºs formatting operations
- Comprehensive benchmark suite included

### üß™ Testing

- **628 tests** with 97%+ coverage
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests for chainable API and edge cases
- Performance benchmarks comparing with Day.js
- Cross-platform testing (Node.js, browsers, Deno)

### üì¶ Distribution

- **ESM** (primary): `dist/index.js`
- **CJS** (Node.js compat): `dist/index.cjs`
- Dual package exports with proper `package.json` configuration
- Hand-written TypeScript declarations

### üìù Notes

- Zero runtime dependencies (constitutional principle)
- Modern JavaScript (ES2020+ target)
- Immutable by default
- Day.js-compatible API for easy migration
