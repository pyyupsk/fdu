  - Automatic month overflow handling (Jan 31 + 1 month ‚Üí Feb 28/29)
  - Leap year support

- **Comparisons**
  - `isBefore()`, `isAfter()`, `isSame()` methods
  - Unit-based comparison (compare by year, month, day, etc.)
  - `diff()` method with multiple unit support

- **Query Methods**
  - Get year, month, date, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond
  - Convert to Date, ISO string, Unix timestamp
  - Validation with `isValid()`

- **Locale Support**
  - Built-in English locale
  - Thai locale included
  - Easy locale registration system

  - Full TypeScript support with strict types
  - Excellent IntelliSense and auto-completion
  - No `any` types in public APIs

### üìä Performance

- **2x faster** than Day.js for common operations
- **< 2KB gzipped** (1.83 KB ESM, 1.73 KB CJS)
- Sub-10Œºs formatting operations
- Comprehensive benchmark suite included

### üß™ Testing

- **330+ tests** with 95%+ coverage
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests for chainable API and edge cases

### üì¶ Distribution

- **ESM** (primary): `dist/esm/index.js`
- **CJS** (Node.js compat): `dist/cjs/index.js`

- Dual package exports with proper `package.json` configuration
- Hand-written TypeScript declarations

### üìö Documentation

- Comprehensive README with examples
- Full API reference
- Migration guide from Day.js
- Contributing guidelines
