  - Unit-based comparison (compare by year, month, day, etc.)
  - `diff()` method with multiple unit support

- **Query Methods**
  - Get year, month, date, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond
  - Convert to Date, ISO string, Unix timestamp
  - Validation with `isValid()`

- **Comprehensive Internationalization (i18n)**

  - Global locale setting with `locale(name)` function
  - Instance-level locale override with `.locale(name)` method
  - Locale persistence through chained operations
  - Graceful fallback to English for unregistered locales
  - Tree-shakable locale files (~300-500 bytes gzipped each)
  - Ordinal day formatting with `Do` token (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
  - Custom meridiem functions for cultural time-of-day naming

  - Excellent IntelliSense and auto-completion
  - No `any` types in public APIs

### üìä Performance

- **2x faster** than Day.js for common operations
- Sub-10Œºs formatting operations
- Comprehensive benchmark suite included

### üß™ Testing

- **628 tests** with 97%+ coverage
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests for chainable API and edge cases
- Performance benchmarks comparing with Day.js
- Cross-platform testing (Node.js, browsers, Deno)

### üì¶ Distribution

- **ESM** (primary): `dist/index.js`
- **CJS** (Node.js compat): `dist/index.cjs`
