`@pyyupsk/fdu` is designed to be lightweight and performant. Here's how it compares to other popular date libraries.

## Bundle Size Comparison

| Library                | Minified      | Minified + Gzipped |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| **@pyyupsk/fdu**       | 9.0 KB        | 3.13 KB            |
| Day.js                 | 7.0 KB        | 2.9 KB             |
| date-fns               | ~70 KB (full) | ~17 KB             |
| Luxon                  | 256 KB        | ~70 KB             |
| Moment.js (deprecated) | ~290 KB       | ~72 KB             |

<Callout type="info">
  Bundle sizes are approximate and may vary depending on which functions you
  import. `@pyyupsk/fdu` is tree-shakable, so you only pay for what you use.
</Callout>

## Performance Benchmarks

Performance tests were run using [Vitest Bench](https://vitest.dev/guide/features.html#benchmarking) on Bun 1.2+ and Node.js 22+.

### Date Parsing

Parsing ISO 8601 date strings (`2025-09-30T14:35:45.123Z`):

| Library          | Operations/sec | Relative Speed  |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| **@pyyupsk/fdu** | ~2,860,000     | 1.0x (baseline) |
| Day.js           | ~1,945,000     | 0.68x           |
| date-fns         | ~127,760       | 0.04x           |
| Luxon            | ~405,000       | 0.14x           |

<Callout type="info">
  date-fns uses `parse()` with format string, Day.js and fdu support direct ISO
  string parsing
</Callout>

### Date Formatting

Formatting dates with pattern `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`:

| Library          | Operations/sec | Relative Speed  |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| **@pyyupsk/fdu** | ~888,000       | 1.0x (baseline) |
| Luxon            | ~534,000       | 0.60x           |
| Day.js           | ~502,000       | 0.57x           |
| date-fns         | ~366,000       | 0.41x           |

### Date Manipulation

Adding 1 day to a date:

| Library          | Operations/sec | Relative Speed  |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| **@pyyupsk/fdu** | ~3,863,000     | 1.0x (baseline) |
| date-fns         | ~2,844,000     | 0.74x           |
| Day.js           | ~892,000       | 0.23x           |
| Luxon            | ~402,000       | 0.10x           |

### Date Comparison

Comparing two dates with `isBefore()`:

| Library          | Operations/sec | Relative Speed  |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| **@pyyupsk/fdu** | ~19,576,000    | 1.0x (baseline) |
| Luxon            | ~7,242,000     | 0.37x           |
| date-fns         | ~4,588,000     | 0.23x           |
| Day.js           | ~1,472,000     | 0.08x           |

## Running Benchmarks Yourself

You can run the benchmarks yourself to verify the results:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pyyupsk/fdu.git
cd fdu

# Install dependencies
bun install
# or
npm install

# Run benchmarks
bun run bench
# or
npm run bench
```

## Methodology

All benchmarks were conducted using:

- **Hardware**: Intel Core i5-12400, 10GB RAM, WSL2
- **Runtime**: Bun 1.2+ / Node.js 22+
- **Framework**: Vitest Bench (experimental benchmarking feature)
- **Test Data**: ISO 8601 date strings (`2025-09-30T14:35:45.123Z`)
- **Iterations**: Each test runs with multiple samples to ensure statistical significance
- **Warmup**: Each benchmark includes a warmup phase to optimize JIT compilation
- **Libraries Tested**:
  - @pyyupsk/fdu v0.0.0-beta.3
  - Day.js v1.11.18
  - date-fns v4.1.0
  - Luxon v3.7.2

2. **Parsing Performance**: **47% faster** than Day.js, **606% faster** than Luxon, **2,138% faster** than date-fns for ISO string parsing
3. **Formatting Performance**: **77% faster** than Day.js, **66% faster** than Luxon, **143% faster** than date-fns
4. **Manipulation**: **333% faster** than Day.js, **860% faster** than Luxon, **36% faster** than date-fns for add operations
5. **Comparison**: **1,230% faster** than Day.js, **170% faster** than Luxon, **327% faster** than date-fns - **fastest date comparison** among all tested libraries

<Callout type="success">
  `@pyyupsk/fdu` provides excellent performance while maintaining a small bundle
  size, making it ideal for both client-side and server-side applications.
</Callout>

## Real-World Performance
