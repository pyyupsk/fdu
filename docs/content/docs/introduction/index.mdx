**fdu** (faster date-time utility) is an ultra-fast, zero-dependency date manipulation library for TypeScript and JavaScript.

## Why fdu?

### ⚡ Ultra-Fast

Built for speed, delivering **~4× faster** performance than Day.js:

- **12× faster** comparisons
- **6× faster** chained operations
- **4× faster** date manipulation
- **2× faster** formatting

[See benchmarks →](/docs/benchmarks)

### 🕐 Temporally Correct

fdu implements time based on how humans actually perceive it:

- **Floor Semantics**: Time differences represent fully elapsed units (1.9 hours → 1 hour)
- **Calendar Arithmetic**: Months/years count calendar boundaries, not duration
- **Temporal Direction**: Earlier < later, negative = past
- **Human-Centric Years**: Year 0 = Year 0 (ISO 8601)

### 💪 TypeScript-First

Unlike libraries where TypeScript types are added later, fdu is **designed in TypeScript from day one**:

- Full type inference for all operations
- Strict null safety
- IntelliSense support everywhere
- No `@types/*` package needed

### 🧭 Immutable & Predictable

Every operation returns a new instance, preventing unexpected mutations:

```typescript
const date = fdu("2025-10-05");
const tomorrow = date.add(1, "day");

console.log(date.format("YYYY-MM-DD")); // '2025-10-05' (unchanged)
console.log(tomorrow.format("YYYY-MM-DD")); // '2025-10-06'
```

### ⚙️ Zero Dependencies

No external dependencies means:

- **Smaller bundle size** - No transitive dependencies
- **Better security** - Fewer attack vectors
- **Faster installs** - No dependency resolution
- **More reliable** - No breaking changes from dependencies

### 🧩 Tree-Shakeable

Modern ESM design ensures you only bundle what you use:

```typescript
// Only imports what you need
import { fdu } from "@pyyupsk/fdu";
import { es } from "@pyyupsk/fdu/locale/es";
import { relativeTime } from "@pyyupsk/fdu/plugins/relative-time";
```

## Design Principles

1. **Temporal correctness first** - Aligned with human time perception
2. **Performance** - Fast operations through correct algorithms
3. **Type safety** - Catch errors at compile time
4. **Immutability** - Predictable behavior
5. **Zero dependencies** - Stay lean and secure
