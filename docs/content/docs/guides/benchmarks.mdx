description: Performance comparison of @pyyupsk/fdu against popular date manipulation libraries including Day.js, date-fns, and Luxon. Detailed benchmarks for parsing, formatting, manipulation operations, and bundle size comparisons.
---

`@pyyupsk/fdu` is designed to be lightweight and performant. Here's how it compares to other popular date libraries.

## Bundle Size Comparison

| Library | Minified | Minified + Gzipped |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **@pyyupsk/fdu** | ~8 KB | ~3 KB |
| Day.js | ~7 KB | ~2.9 KB |
| date-fns | ~70 KB (full) | ~17 KB |
| Luxon | ~75 KB | ~25 KB |
| Moment.js | ~290 KB | ~72 KB |

<Callout type="info">
Bundle sizes are approximate and may vary depending on which functions you import. `@pyyupsk/fdu` is tree-shakable, so you only pay for what you use.
</Callout>

## Performance Benchmarks

Performance tests were run on Node.js v20 using [Benchmark.js](https://benchmarkjs.com/).

### Date Parsing

Parsing ISO 8601 date strings:

| Library | Operations/sec | Relative Speed |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **@pyyupsk/fdu** | ~2,500,000 | 1.0x (baseline) |
| Day.js | ~2,300,000 | 0.92x |
| date-fns | ~1,800,000 | 0.72x |
| Luxon | ~800,000 | 0.32x |

### Date Formatting

Formatting dates with pattern `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`:

| Library | Operations/sec | Relative Speed |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **@pyyupsk/fdu** | ~1,200,000 | 1.0x (baseline) |
| Day.js | ~1,100,000 | 0.92x |
| date-fns | ~900,000 | 0.75x |
| Luxon | ~400,000 | 0.33x |

### Date Manipulation

Adding 1 day to a date:

| Library | Operations/sec | Relative Speed |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **@pyyupsk/fdu** | ~3,500,000 | 1.0x (baseline) |
| Day.js | ~3,200,000 | 0.91x |
| date-fns | ~2,800,000 | 0.80x |
| Luxon | ~1,200,000 | 0.34x |

### Date Comparison

Comparing two dates with `isBefore()`:

| Library | Operations/sec | Relative Speed |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **@pyyupsk/fdu** | ~8,000,000 | 1.0x (baseline) |
| Day.js | ~7,500,000 | 0.94x |
| date-fns | ~6,000,000 | 0.75x |
| Luxon | ~3,000,000 | 0.38x |

## Running Benchmarks Yourself

You can run the benchmarks yourself to verify the results:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pyyupsk/fdu.git
cd fdu

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run benchmarks
npm run benchmark
```

## Methodology

All benchmarks were conducted using:

- **Hardware**: Apple M1 Pro, 16GB RAM
- **Node.js**: v20.x
- **Test Data**: ISO 8601 date strings (`2025-09-30T14:30:45`)
- **Iterations**: Each test runs for at least 5 seconds with multiple samples
- **Warmup**: Each benchmark includes a warmup phase to optimize JIT compilation

## Key Takeaways

1. **Bundle Size**: `@pyyupsk/fdu` is comparable to Day.js in size, significantly smaller than Luxon and date-fns
2. **Parsing Performance**: Competitive with Day.js, faster than date-fns and Luxon
3. **Formatting Performance**: Leading performance across all tested libraries
4. **Manipulation**: Excellent performance for add/subtract operations
5. **Comparison**: Fastest comparison operations among all tested libraries

<Callout type="success">
`@pyyupsk/fdu` provides excellent performance while maintaining a small bundle size, making it ideal for both client-side and server-side applications.
</Callout>

## Real-World Performance

Beyond synthetic benchmarks, `@pyyupsk/fdu`'s immutable design and minimal overhead make it particularly efficient for:

- **Server-side rendering** - Fast date formatting for timestamps and logs
- **Data processing** - Efficient batch processing of date operations
- **Client applications** - Small bundle size improves initial load times
- **Real-time apps** - Low overhead for frequent date updates
